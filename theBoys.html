         In he's own words.<br>
          "Psychobilly Cadillac, probably around 1999-2000. This motorcycle changed my life. Jesse Gregory James hammered out the top tank skin for it, all of the hubless running gear was still roughed-out & exposed. You can steal a peek at those expensive bearings."</p>
