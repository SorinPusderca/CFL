        A <b>chopper</b> is a type of <u>custom motorcycle</u> which emerged in
        California in the late 1950s. A chopper employs radically modified
        steering angles and lengthened forks for a stretched-out appearance.<br />
        They can be built from an original motorcycle which is modified
        ("chopped") or built from scratch. Some of the characteristic features
        of choppers are long front ends with extended forks often coupled with
        an increased rake angle, hardtail frames (frames without rear
        suspension), very tall "ape hanger" or very short "drag" handlebars,
        lengthened or stretched frames, and larger than stock front
        wheels.<br />
        The "sissy bar", a set of tubes that connect the rear fender with the
        frame, and which are often extended several feet high, is a signature
        feature on many choppers.<br /><br />

        West Coast Choppers (WCC) is a brand that began selling screen-printed
        T-shirts and stickers with the company's Iron cross/Maltese cross logo
        while founder and "master marketer" Jesse James was finishing high
        school, packaging the accoutrements of the chopper lifestyle long before
        any actual West Coast Choppers customs had been ordered or sold. Even
        after the company did begin building custom choppers, 60% of revenue
        still came from sales of WCC-branded marketing tie-ins such as clothing,
        beverages and tools. Yearly sales of approximately 12–15 motorcycles at
        prices of around US$150,000 each actually lost money for the company,
        but attracted positive attention.

        Publicizing the names of celebrity clients, including Shaquille O'Neal,
        Kid Rock, Keanu Reeves, Ty Law of the Denver Broncos, wrestling star
        Bill Goldberg, actor Tyson Beckford, and NFL running back Jamal
        Anderson, was a central feature of the WCC marketing strategy. The other
        key to this strategy was the star power of Jesse James, presented mainly
        through television on the Discovery Channel in the Motorcycle Mania
        series and the 2002–2006 series Monster Garage. The Long Beach,
        California headquarters of West Coast Choppers shut down in 2010, but
        later reopened in 2013 with a new headquarters in Austin, Texas.

        Before there were choppers, there was the bobber, meaning a motorcycle
        that had been "bobbed", or relieved of excess weight by removing parts,
        particularly the fenders, with the intent of making it lighter and thus
        faster, or at least making it look better in the eyes of a rider seeking
        a more minimalist ride. An early example of a bobber is the 1940 Indian
        Sport Scout "Bob-Job" which toured in the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle
        exhibition. Indian Scouts and Chiefs of the time came with extravagantly
        large, heavily valanced fenders, nearly reaching the center of the wheel
        on the luxurious 1941 Indian Series 441 while racing bikes had tiny
        fenders or none at all. The large and well-appointed bikes exemplified
        the "dresser" motorcycle aesthetic and providing a counterpoint to the
        minimalist bobber, and café racers.

    <h2>Late 1950s to 1960s - early choppers</h2>

    <br />

    <p>
      By the early 1960s there was a big enough contingent of people modifying
      motorcycles, still mostly big Harley-Davidsons, that a certain style had
      begun to take hold. A set of modifications became common: the fat tires
      and 16" wheels of the stock motorcycles were replaced with narrower tires
      often on a larger 19" or 21" wheel. Forward-mounted foot pegs replaced the
      standard large 'floorboard' foot rests. Frequently the standard headlight
      and fuel tank were replaced with much smaller ones. Often upgraded chromed
      parts (either one-off fabricated replacements or manually chromed stock
      parts) were added. It is in this era that what we would today consider a
      chopper came into existence and began to be called the chopper.

        During the 1960s, candy-colored paint, often multicolored and
        metal-flaked with different patterns, became a trend that allowed
        builders to further express their individuality and artistry. Soon many
        parts were being offered by small companies expressly for use in
        building choppers, not necessarily as performance parts as was common in
        the Bobber Era
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The first famous chopper builders came to prominence in this era,
        including <b>Arlen Ness</b> who was a leader in the "Frisco" or "Bay
        Area Chopper" style. Ness's bikes were characterized by having long low
        frames and highly raked front ends, typically 45 degrees or more, and
        frequently made use of springer front ends.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In 1967 <b>Denver Mullins</b> and <b>Mondo Porra</b> opened
        <b>Denver's Choppers in San Bernardino, California</b> and soon became
        famous for building "long bikes", often referred to as "Denver
        choppers". These featured even longer front ends than the Bay Area
        style, and had a much higher frame (stretched "up and out"). Denver's
        was particularly well known for the springer forks that they fabricated,
        as well as the overall style of their bikes.
